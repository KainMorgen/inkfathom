Deck In A Bottle is a webapp to format and display a mtg deck in the goal to create proxies.

## Motive

MTG is a great game. A great but expensive game. I can't afford to pay for a card I wont like after two or three game. Sometimes we have to try one to know. In another hand, I mostly play offline and proxies are acceptable in most casual game. Since I can't find a good deck templater, I made one. I don't want to keep copy/paste image in a document editor (Libre Office, Microsoft Word, or whatever). Here we go.

## Stack

All the code can run on any modern machine with a webbrowser. Everything works client-side. Bare old vanillaJS and HTML/CSS. No more no less.

Picture rendering come from the [DeckBrew's API](https://deckbrew.com/api/).
